### Prerequisites

* Bamboo is installed, let's assume it's at http://localhost:8085

    * If not installed, follow their [installation guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/getting-started-with-bamboo-289277283.html?_ga=2.95849887.246880307.1531709232-1995250601.1528082340) to download and setup Bamboo

### Create a project and link to GitHub

Setup your first project and link it to your app repository that we will test with Kobiton later. You may reference [this guideline](https://www.360logica.com/blog/how-to-create-and-run-your-first-project-in-bamboo/) for more details on how to setup a project and link GitHub in your plan configurations. 

Now that you have created a project and plan, you can now start configuring tasks. In the [next guideline](running-automation-testing.md), we will configure tasks that will allow us to run an automation test with Kobiton.
